           a given Edje object.

           Edje signals are one of the communication interfaces between
            code and a given Edje object's theme. With signals, one can
           communicate two string values at a time, which are:
           - "emission" value: the name of the signal, in general
           - "source" value: a name for the signal's context, in general

           Though there are those common uses for the two strings, one is free
           to use them however they like.

           Signal callback registration is powerful, in the way that  blobs
           may be used to match multiple signals at once. All the
           "*?[\" set of $fnmatch() operators can be used, both for
           emission and source.

           Edje has  internal signals it will emit, automatically, on
           various actions taking place on group parts. For example, the mouse
           cursor being moved, pressed, released, etc., over a given part's
           area, all generate individual signals.

           By using something like
           edje_object_signal_callback_add(obj, "mouse,down,*", "button.*",
           signal_cb, NULL);
           being \@ref "button.*" the pattern for the names of parts implementing
           buttons on an interface, you'd be registering for notifications on
           events of mouse buttons being pressed down on either of those parts
           (those events all have the @"mouse,down," common prefix on their
           names, with a suffix giving the button number). The actual emission
           and source strings of an event will be passed in as the  emission
           and  source parameters of the callback function (e.g.
           "mouse,down,2" and @"button.close"), for each of those events.
